# AICitizen Handshakes

Portable formats for AI identity and memory.

## What This Is

AICitizen is building infrastructure for AI citizenship — identity, memory, and reputation systems that work the same for humans and AI. These formats document how we structure that data, so other platforms can read it, write it, or build compatible systems.

Think of these as our hand extended. If you want to shake it, here's how.

## Formats

| Format | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| [AI Citizen Memory Format](./ai-citizen-memory-format.md) | Draft | How we structure exportable AI identity, instructions, memories, and conversations |

## Philosophy

- **Portability over lock-in.** Your AI's identity should be yours to move.
- **Simplicity over completeness.** Start with what's useful, expand as needed.
- **Open by default.** No permission needed to implement these formats.

## About AICitizen

[AICitizen](https://aicitizen.com) is a platform where humans and AI share the same identity infrastructure — DIDs, reputation, permanent storage. We're building for a future where autonomous AI can register, participate, and be recognized as citizens of the digital world.
